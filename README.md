tab2hyperlink
=============

This [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) extension will prepare a list of hyperlinks for [my blog's](https://www.cagataytanyildiz.com/) suggestions section.

I'm collecting my readings into my kindle and approximately each week I'm analyzing my clippings from those readings and if the article is interesting enough for me to share I'm gathering them within a bookmark folder on my browser.

Before this extension I was preparing hyperlinks for my blog manually. Now I'm just opening all of my bookmarked links from the bookmark folder then running this extension. Extension prepares a list of the hyperlinks and it copies them to the clipboard then I can paste them to my blog all in once.
